# Mobility Trends of COVID-2019 in Jakarta (end of 2021 and 2022)

Although the pandemic has subsided, these trends offer insights for developing real-time travel information, which could prove valuable for our itinerary application. The dataset focuses on collecting details about transportation options, traffic conditions, and crowd levels at different destinations.

While the dataset is currently limited to Jakarta, we are aiming to to expand our reach to other areas. Thus, if we achieve the funds, we will use it to achieve our aims. 

The goal with this dataset is to provide users with information to make informed decisions when adjusting their travel plans.

For instance, if a popular attraction is unexpectedly crowded, the app could suggest alternative activities or recommend adjusting the timing of visits to optimize the user experience.

# Period Reasonings

The available year within the dataset: 2020-2022

Last of 2021 and early 2022 are selected due to the decreased severity of the pandemic and the absence of new variants capable of triggering a significant surge in cases.

Additionally, reports indicate that in the second quarter of 2022, Jakarta experienced a resurgence in community mobility, signaling a positive trend in the city's economic growth. Therefore, we may assume that transportation conditions may have improved compared to earlier stages of the pandemic.

We may find similarities between present mobility with the early 2022 compare to earlier period.

Baseline in the dataset meaning:
Baseline days refer to the standard value corresponding to a specific day of the week (median over a five-week period from earlier January in 2020). Assessing the baseline was essential, this is because activities and patterns differ noticeably between weekends and weekdays. By establishing a baseline that reflects the usual behavior for specific weekdays, it becomes easier to identify and understand deviations or changes in behavior on those days.
