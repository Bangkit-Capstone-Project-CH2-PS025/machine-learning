# Mobility Trends of COVID-2019 in Jakarta Year 2022

Although the pandemic has subsided, these trends offer insights for developing real-time travel information, which could prove valuable for our itinerary application. The dataset focuses on collecting details about transportation options, traffic conditions, and crowd levels at different destinations.

While the dataset is currently limited to Jakarta, we are aiming to to expand our reach to other areas. Thus, if we achieve the funds, we will use it to achieve our aims. 

The goal with this dataset is to provide users with information to make informed decisions when adjusting their travel plans.

For instance, if a popular attraction is unexpectedly crowded, the app could suggest alternative activities or recommend adjusting the timing of visits to optimize the user experience.

# Why Choose the Year 2022?

This year is selected due to the decreased severity of the pandemic and the absence of new variants capable of triggering a significant surge in cases.

Additionally, reports indicate that in the second quarter of 2022, Jakarta experienced a resurgence in community mobility, signaling a positive trend in the city's economic growth. Therefore, we may assume that transportation conditions may have improved compared to earlier stages of the pandemic.
