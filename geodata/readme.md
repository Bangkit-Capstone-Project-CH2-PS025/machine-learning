# Geodata Analysis

## Disclaimer
The analysis presented here is not meant for display in the mobile application and won't be available for use during the finalization of the capstone period. 

## Objective
The geodata serves as a demonstration of the enhancements made to our project. When suggesting places to users, geographical variables are intended to be taken into consideration. This involves identifying and recommending nearby points of interest, like tourist attractions, restaurants, and landmarks, based on the user's location and preferences (note: the budgeting part is not yet implemented here).
